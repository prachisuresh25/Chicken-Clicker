Chicken Clicker
A serious platform for meaningless interaction.
Chicken Clicker is a useless website where the only thing you can do is click a chicken.
There is no goal. No reward. No progress.

The website tracks:
how many times you clicked
how much real time you wasted
how concerned the chicken becomes

If you stop clicking, the session ends.
If you keep clicking… the chicken might leave.
This project is intentionally pointless.

Why does this exist?
To explore how easily humans interact with things that do absolutely nothing.
